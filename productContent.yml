  paragraphs:
    - Design and used by nerds and for nerds blockchain products often seem complex and discouraging. Neufund's goal is blockchain's demystification and seamless transition from traditional systems for everyone.
    - In practice it means simple wiring of crypto-funds to the Platform's investment account, and couple clicks to invest on blockchain in the real shares, which then as equity tokens are stored in an investor's portfolio.
    - Neufund creates the new set of industry standards integrated with the legal systems.

  paragraphs:
    - Secondary market = liquidity.
    - Asset liquidation possible for investors and startups from day one after ICO (secondary market drives primary market of innovation) assuring efficient investment decisions and instant capitalisation.
    - The Platform provides a mechanism for the  distribution of the fees and proceeds to token holders. Since the primary value of equity tokens is economic, the proceeds distribution is the investors’ fundamental right. Such proceeds are deposited into an equity token distribution pool where they may be claimed by token holders.
