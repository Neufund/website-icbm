  questions:
  - question : "What is an ICO?"
    answer : "An ICO, short for Initial Coin (or Crowd) Offering, is a fundraising mechanism enabled by a set of technologies under the umbrella term of “blockchain”. These include cryptocurrencies, cryptotokens, distributed ledgers, and of course blockchains themselves. Generally, ICOs are about distributing tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency. This fundraising mechanism was first used by Omni (formerly Mastercoin) on July 31, 2013, with a special “Exodus Address” on the Bitcoin network. Since then, the ICO space has steadily grown, leading to an explosion of projects and companies using it in 2016 and ever since."
  - question : "What is an ICBM? Why did you call your ICO an ICBM?"
    answer : "The Initial Capital Building Mechanism is a process corresponding loosely to the now common ICO process employed by other blockchain projects. In our case, it kickstarts our investment ecosystem by delivering liquidity to the Neufund platform. This corresponds to commitments by participants to make investments in future Equity Token Offerings of companies on the platform. Capital Building is the only purpose; Neufund does not rely on the ICBM to fund operations. We do not even have access to funds committed by ICBM participants. Funds remain under their sole control; perhaps that’s the main difference between a typical ICO and our ICBM. Neufund’s ICBM takes place in Autumn 2017."
  - question : "What is a Commitment Transaction?"
    answer : "Commitment Transaction is the term we use for commitment of funds (Ether or Euro Token) by contributors during the ICBM to the Platform for later investment, which is rewarded by the Neumark, Neufund’s Platform token."
  - question : "What is a Euro Token (EURT)?"
    answer : "The Euro Token (EURT) is an on-chain representation of the fiat currency Euro within the Neufund Platform. Our EURT cannot live, or be used, outside the Platform."

- title: "Basic questions"
  questions:
  - question: What is NEUFUND?
    answer: NEUFUND is a community-owned fundraising platform. Companies can use our legal and technical infrastructure to legally issue (on our platform) a new type of asset, which we call tokenized equity, and into which virtually anyone can invest. The Neufund platform thus acts as a bridge between the mainstream investment world and the blockchain space.
  - question: When is the NEUFUND ICBM going to take place?
    answer: The Neufund ICBM is going to take place this autumn 2017. Further information will be published very soon on <a href="https://commit.neufund.org">commit.neufund.org</a>
  - question: Why is Neufund not doing a normal ICO?
    answer: "Thanks to our investors we are able to build Neufund without having to raise large amounts of funds from the public. Also, because Neufund is a two-sided marketplace for legally valid investments, we face a different set of challenges than the average blockchain platform does: we want investors and companies to join and perform transactions. We bootstrap this process by incentivizing early adopters with a particularly advantageous Neumark reward for committing their funds to the platform early. Once the Neufund platform is live, we take fees for successful investments, which suffices for covering the expenses of running the platform. As a consequence, a regular ICO is unnecessary – and even counterproductive – both for funding our operations and bootstrapping our platform."

      <p>We will also require participants to read and accept legal documents that will govern the ICBM. These will be available shortly before the ICBM start.</p>

  - question : "How can I participate in Neufund’s ICBM?"
    answer : |
      Follow the instructions laid out on the <a href="https://commit.neufund.org">Commit Page</a>.
  - question : How can I verify whether I am using the correct website?
    answer : |
      Make sure that the address is <a href="https://commit.neufund.org">commit.neufund.org</a>. Use the bookmarking function of your browser to save the page for easy access on the big day. 
  - question : "How do I know whether I am legally allowed to participate?"
    answer : |
      <p>We want the ICBM to be open to everyone. However, due to legal reasons we might be forced to exclude participation of certain persons or entities.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are a US citizen or entity, or a representative of such person or entity, you are not legally allowed to participate.</p>
  - question : "Which wallet providers does Neufund support?"
    answer : |
      <p>We support myetherwallet, Metamask, Parity, and web3 as well as Ledger Nano S hardware wallets. Any ERC20 compatible wallet should work. Please make sure to use a wallet where you are in control of your private key.</p>
      <p>Be aware that wallets on exchanges are NOT supported.</p>
  - question : What ETH address can I use to participate? Can I send my ETH from an exchange account?
    answer : |
      Please only use an address you have exclusive control over and that is provided by one of the supported wallets. DO NOT use an exchange account address.
  - question : Where can I purchase ETH?
    answer : |
      You can purchase ETH at any exchange such as <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://bittrex.com/">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://poloniex.com/">Poloniex</a>, <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/">Bitstamp</a>, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, and a number of others.
  - question : Is there a minimum or maximum amount of funds I can participate with?
    answer : |
      There is a minimum ticket size of 1 ETH and no maximum ticket size.
  - question : How will I know whether my commitment was successful if the Ethereum network is overloaded?
    answer : |
      On the Ethereum network you can be fairly certain that your transaction is executed with just one confirmed block. However, it is customary to say that 12 blocks provides almost 100% guarantee. For funds committed directly from the commitment page we provide a link to <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> where you can observe the number of confirmations in real time. If you use your own wallet, please refer to its manual for guidance.
  - question : What are the reward ratio and exchange rate mechanisms?
    answer : |
      <p>The Neumark reward starts out at 6.5 Neumark per EURT and declines from there according to the following curve:<img src="./assets/curve.png" alt="curve" width="300"></p>
      <p>However, every Neumark reward is split: 50% goes to the person committing funds, 50% go to the platform operator Fifth Force GmbH. In effect then, the Neumark reward for the first contributor starts out at 3.25 Neumark per EURT.</p>
      <p>During the commitment process you will find a calculator to estimate the reward you are likely to get for your commitment of funds.</p>
  - question : Does Neufund do a pre-ICO?
    answer : |
      Yes. It will be announced on our Slack channel, which you can join <a href="https://neufundorg.signup.team/">here</a>. You can also write to <a href="mailto:hello@neufund.org">hello@neufund.org</a> for details.
  - question : When will tokens be distributed?
    answer : |
      <p>Instantly after the funds are committed. However, investment transactions using the EURT will only become possible at the launch of the Neufund platform.</p>
      <p>NEU will be immediately tradable after an exchange offers trading. We hope this will be a short timespan, but ultimately depends on the exchanges. It is therefore likely to begin after the ICBM.</p>
  - question : What types of currencies can I use to participate in Neufund’s ICBM?
    answer : |
      <p>Neufund only accepts ETH, or “Ether” (Ethereum’s native token), and EURT (Euro Token). The first phase is open exclusively for participants who wish to send ETH, and runs for one month. </p>
      <p>Neufund does not accept other currencies, neither crypto-based nor fiat.</p>
  - question : Will there be a lock-up on funds committed in the ICBM?
    answer : |
      Your committed funds are locked for use on the Neufund platform for a duration of 18 months (months of 30 days length) after your original commitment. Once that time period ends, you will be able to withdraw 100% of your committed funds, and at the same time must burn an amount of Neumarks equivalent to the total reward you received. You are also able to withdraw 90% of the EUR value of your funds (at the time of commitment) at any time before that date. The remaining 10% will be distributed among other Neumark holders.
  - question : Where can I get help with committing my funds?
    answer : |
      <a href="https://neufundorg.signup.team/">Join our Slack</a> and talk with our team members, or reach out to us at <a href="mailto:commit@neufund.org">commit@neufund.org</a>.
  - question : How do I connect with Neufund on Social Media?
    answer : |
      You can find us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/neufundorg/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/neufundorg">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neufund/">Reddit</a>.
  - question : Has the smart contract code been professionally audited for security?
    answer : |
      The smart contract code is currently being audited. The results will be published as soon as they become available.

- title: "Neufund’s token - Neumark"
  questions:
  - question : What are Neumarks?
    answer : |
      Neumarks are Neufund’s protocol tokens which participants earn by committing capital to the platform. They entitle their holders to revenues from platform fees for ETOs (Equity Token Offerings) taking place on Neufund, as well as economic benefit from a platform portfolio pool holding a small amount of every ETO ever conducted. The amount of Neumarks held represents the individual stake in the Neufund ecosystem. In total, they thus represent the value of Neufund’s entire token economy. As an attractive asset, they are apt for secondary trading and can easily be transferred among users.
  - question : What makes Neumarks different from other tokens? What does Neumark offer that others do not?
    answer : |
      Most tokens sold in ICOs today are either utility tokens or simple speculation assets. Neumark is neither. Instead, it entitles its holder to revenues from platform fees for ETOs (Equity Token Offerings) taking place on Neufund, as well as economic benefit from a platform portfolio pool holding a small amount of every ETO ever conducted.
  - question : How do I purchase Neumarks?
    answer : |
      Neumarks are not being purchased in the first place. Contributors receive Neumarks as a reward for contributing to the ecosystem. For every successful investment in a company on our platform one will receive Neumarks until the total supply of € 1.5 b is reached. 
  - question : When do I get Neumarks? 
    answer : |
      Neumarks are received immediately after funds have been committed in Neufund’s Initial Capital Building Mechanism (→ICBM), or when investing on the NEUFUND platform at a later stage. 
  - question : Is Neumark a security?
    answer : |
      No, Neumark is not a security. This conclusion is the outcome of extensive legal analysis of the German law conducted by professional attorneys. Neufund is aware that questions regarding the regulatory status of Neumarks in other jurisdictions will be discussed. Since we cannot exclude different regulatory treatment of Neumarks in all jurisdictions, participants from the US, and potentially also other non-supported countries, will not be able to take part in the ICBM event.
  - question : What rights do Neumark holders have?
    answer : |
      The value of Neumarks results from fees and participation in a platform pool of equity tokens, and thus gives economic ownership of the network to its holders: (1) With each successful Equity Token Offering, a small fee is deducted from the invested amount. This platform fee is then distributed to Neumark holders pro rata. (2) Within the same Equity Token Offering, a small fee in form of company equity tokens is deducted from the total tokens that were acquired. This token participation fee is added to a platform portfolio of all companies ever to conduct a token sale on the platform.
  - question : Is there a hard cap on Neumarks generated during the ICBM?
    answer : |
      We have a technical hardcap at € 200m.
  - question : How many Neumark tokens will be available during the ICBM and how many will be created in total?
    answer : |
      The first € 100m committed (or, more strictly speaking, value of ETH committed in EUR) will be rewarded with 35% of the total supply of Neumarks ever to be generated. Overall, 1,5 bln NEU will be generated.
  - question : Are there any bonuses or discounts available?
    answer : |
      The bonus is implied in the structure of Neumark’s issuance curve. The earlier you reserve your funds, the better your ratio of Neumarks per committed EUR is.
  - question : When will NEU come to market/exchanges? Do you have partnerships with exchanges yet?
    answer : |
      We have ongoing conversations with several exchanges about listing NEU and expect listings to become available in at least one or more exchanges immediately upon the start of the ICBM. 

- title: Legal questions
  questions:
  - question : Do contributors need to go through KYC procedures during Neufund’s ICBM?
    answer : |
      We are not planning KYC measures during the ICBM itself. However, if you intend to perform investments on the platform, you will have to undergo a KYC process before being able to carry them out. This only applies to participants committing funds in ETH.
  - question : What is the downside protection?
    answer : |
      <p>For one, we do not have access to your ETH or EURT, since all funds are held in a smart contract. This contract itself is currently being audited for security and allows you to withdraw your funds at any time. If you do so before an 18 month period of 30 day months has passed after your commitment, you will be able to withdraw 90% of the EUR value of your funds (at the time of commitment) at any time before that date. The remaining 10% will be distributed among other Neumark holders.</p>
      <p>In addition, token holder rights are protected by regular legal means with the appropriate legal documentation.</p>
  - question : Who can reserve funds to invest on the NEUFUND platform?
    answer : |
      Virtually anybody can participate in Neufund’s Initial Capital Building Mechanism (→ICBM), given that she is not based in the US or has a US citizenship. Neufund tokens (Neumarks) themselves are not securities, commodities, swaps on either securities or commodities, or similar financial instruments. Nevertheless, it was decided that US citizens, residents and entities should be excluded from reserving funds to invest on the Neufund platform. This is mainly due to the logistical challenges that come with respective regulations. With the platform launch, we will ask you to go through an authorisation process for both your and our safety. 
  - question : Is the Neufund ICBM open to US contributors?
    answer : |
      No. US contributors are not allowed to participate.
  - question : Why are you building Neufund under the German law?
    answer : |
      Germany offers a sound legal ground for ambitious projects. We remain open for developments in other jurisdictions that may prove advantageous for Neufund in the future. However, we are already able to do our business globally thanks to our innovative legal structure built under German law.
  - question : What is the Blacklist of countries participating in Neufund’s ICBM?
    answer : |
      All US contributors, whether legal or natural persons or their representatives, are excluded from participation. We cannot exclude that due to a dynamic situation in various jurisdictions we will be forced to exclude persons from other countries.
  - question : How is Neufund affected by the SEC announcement?
    answer : |
      <p>At Neufund we understand that the regulatory environment is dynamic, and that we can’t say how the treatment of tokens will be viewed by various regulatory authorities ahead of time. To be safe, however, we have decided to exclude US contributors until a favourable, firm regulatory framework has been established.</p>
      <p>Currently, we are complying with existing German law and the greater EU framework, as determined by our legal experts.</p>
