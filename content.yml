        The community we’ve built at Tandem has been the most rewarding thing, so we wanted to give back. And what is better than owning a share in the company? Thanks to Neufund we can build even stronger ties to the people that support us!

        Europe needs more innovation. More talented people solving real problems. There is still a significant gap between Europe and the US when it comes to innovation capital. We're talking about five to eight times less innovation capital available. When I see Neufund, it's a platform to finance innovation. It offers a simple way with less transactions costs, for investors to engage with innovative founders. I believe that it could have a huge impact on the ecosystem, and I think Neufund gonna be huge.
