        <p>Neumarks entitle their holders to revenues from all the future investments’ success fees. They also allow the holders to participate in the economic benefit from a platform portfolio of all the startups tokens that will ever launch. They are generated every time the investor reserves capital on the platform or invest in the startups.</p>
        <p><strong>If you reserve your ETH now you are getting NEU for free, if not, to get NEU you have to invest in the startups first.</strong> You can capitalise on Neumarks by hodling or by trading without vesting on secondary market from day one.</p>
