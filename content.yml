      paragraph1:  |
        Neufund's ICO is a call to commit Capital to the Neufund
        Platform in exchange for tokens, that's why we call it ICBM
        - Initial Capital Building Mechanism.
      paragraph2:  |
        Reserve ETH in your personal Ethereum wallet. You have 18
        months to pick your favourite investments. Not investing
        results in full release.

        economic benefit from a platform portfolio of all the startups tokens that will ever launch.
      paragraph2:  |
        <strong>First come better served. The sooner you reserve your
        funds the more NEU you per ETH.</strong> You can capitalize on
        Neumarks by <i>hodling</i> or by trading without vesting on secondary market
        from day one.

  title: "Invest fully legally in ICOs of equity tokens or utility tokens in any company in the world"
  paragrapha:  |
        Using our legal and technical infrastructure, startups and established companies alike can legally issue a new type of asset we call tokenized equity – 
        in essence, digital shares. We achieve this by formally linking paper contracts with Ethereum smart contracts through mutual reference and code correspondence.
        Neufund enables investment in tokens that represents rights other than equity, like utility tokens, protocol tokens, and any tokens backed by a SAFT agreement.
