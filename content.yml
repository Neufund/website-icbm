        Neufund opens the investment process of ICOs for all ventures, blockchain-based or not, as well as investors. Using our legal and technical infrastructure, investors can invest with both ETH and EUR; startups and established companies alike can issue a new type of asset we call tokenized equity – in essence, digital shares. Such crypto tokens reflect the value of the business operating in the real, off-chain world and at the same time are as liquid as a currency.

        The community we’ve built at Tandem has been the most rewarding thing, so we wanted to give back. And what is better than owning a share in the company? Thanks to Neufund we can build even stronger ties to the people that support us!

        Here at Jodel we love the crypto world and how it brings communities closer together. That’s what we’re all about! So when we decided to raise funds from our own community and the ICO model didn’t meet our needs, we came across Neufund.

        Europe needs more innovation. More talented people solving real problems. There is still a significant gap between Europe and the US when it comes to innovation capital. We're talking about five to eight times less innovation capital available. When I see Neufund, it's a platform to finance innovation. It offers a simple way with less transactions costs, for investors to engage with innovative founders. I believe that it could have a huge impact on the ecosystem, and I think Neufund gonna be huge.
